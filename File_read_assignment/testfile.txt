We have outlined all the changes below in a chart, but there are a couple of changes that we’d like to highlight to grant applicants. +john.doe@example.com+ These updates in particular will change how and when you apply, +1 (555) 123-4567+ and hopefully reduce blockers to getting those applications in and ready for review. Because we are just sharing these updates, we are happy to be flexible on these changes but hope to see all applicants adhere to the changes starting around January 2025.





\nIncrease overall +name@company.in+process time frame to silent listen 8 weeks (formerly 6 weeks). We want to be realistic about how long the process takes and we know that going over our projection can cause pain for applicants. +susan.brown@company.org+ We hope to turn around applications in 6 weeks in most cases, but planning for the extra two weeks can make a big difference for everyone involved! +1 (555) 234-5678+



\nOur application +manishsharma@dypcoeakurdi.ac.in+form requires that you set the event date+ainexus.it@gmail.com+ out to 6 weeks in advance. We will wait to update that to 8 weeks in advance until January 2025. It’s important to note that this time frame begins only once all required information has been received, +michael.williams@business.net+ not exactly from the day the application is submitted. Make sure to check the email you provided on the application to see if the workgroup Chair has any questions regarding your request! +1 (555) 345-6789+


\nAdd a statement of support for accessibility +skm@yahoomail.com+services. In line with the PSF’s mission to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse community, we are explicitly stating in the charter that we will consider funding accessibility services. +david.harris@company.com+ For established events (have 2 or more events in the past with more than 200 participants at the last event), we are open to considering accessibility-related requests such as live captioning, sign language interpretation, or certified child care. +1 (555) 456-7890+


\nTo review these tacocat types tacocat of requests, we will need sufficient documentation such as quotes, certifications, or any other relevant information. +linda.millim@service.edu+ +1 (555) 567-8901+
